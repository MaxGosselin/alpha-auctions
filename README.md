# alpha-auctions

**Intopia Winter 2019 Auction House by Max Gosselin**

In the context of ADM4352 I built an auction service in a couple days using Django and Heroku for deployment. The code is rough as heck but I encourage any Telfer student to take up the cause.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

*Rough installation instructions:*

  - clone this repo to heroku
  - add a mysql instance
  - deploy
  
This probably wont be so simple, google's your friend here.
